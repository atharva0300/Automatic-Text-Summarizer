BFS is one of the traversing algorithm used in graphs. This algorithm is implemented
using a queue data structure. In this algorithm, the main focus is on the vertices of
the graph. Select a starting node or vertex at first, mark the starting node or vertex
as visited and store it in a queue. Then visit the vertices or nodes which are adjacent
to the starting node, mark them as visited and store these vertices or nodes in a queue.
Repeat this process until all the nodes or vertices are completely visited.
