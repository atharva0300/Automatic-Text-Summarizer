Bless all to the West, YaHoWha!Bless all to the North, YaHoWha!Bless all to the South, YaHoWha!”Wait, what the hell did I get myself into?But nothing had prepared me for the otherworldly ambience.Or an afternoon spent discussing sex magic and the Lemurian astral plane and communing with the dead, as casually as most people discuss traffic.I consider myself something of a skeptic by professional nature.I have never owned a crystal or a tarot deck.Isis is an original member of the Source Family, a 1970s utopian commune of roughly 140 hippies who lived in a Georgian-style mansion in Los Feliz known as the Mother House.Part of the enduring fascination around the Source Family, like other cults of the time period, is that their history is the stuff of American myth-making, full of details far wilder than any tall tale.Born on Independence Day 1922, he was a psychedelic rock band frontman, a convicted killer, an alleged bank robber, and a decorated ex-Marine with a predilection for purple Rolls-Royces.Day One was biblical being around him,” Zarathustra Aquarian had told me earlier that afternoon.Unlike some of its 70s cult contemporaries—the Manson family were practically neighbors, after all—most former members of the Source Family still describe it as a transformative, largely positive experience.The cult/commune is remembered for a number of things, among them their jam band, Ya Ho Wha 13, whose albums are still highly sought-after by collectors of psychedelic rock, but their most enduring legacy is food, including a killer salad dressing.During the early 70s, they operated The Source, on Sunset Boulevard, one of the most influential alternative restaurants in the United States.The premise was simple: straightforward food, totally vegetarian, mostly raw, some “organic,” and all as fresh as possible.“There’s this idea of food that’s all very fresh, close to raw, very clean, very low-fat, very colorful.But there’s also the idea that through all these supplements and vitamins, you’re boosting your beauty and you’re boosting your performance as a human.” That manifests in kale salads and juice cleanses and plant-based protein, but also in another cult-ish sect, Silicon Valley, with its obsession with self-optimization through biohacking and intermittent fasting.That dense sprouted-grain bread?A legacy of Edmond Bordeaux Szekely, who falsely claimed to have unearthed texts in the Vatican archive in which no less than Jesus himself told us how we should eat.The humble graham cracker?A nod to Sylvester Graham, the 19th-century Presbyterian minister obsessed with the idea that whole grains have the power to put an end to masturbation.The Source Family borrowed from all of the above, while adding a few ingredients of their own.At 47, he had already lived several lives.He had fought the Nazis in World War II as a U.S. Marine, went to Hollywood to become a stuntman, and made a small fortune from two restaurants, the Aware Inn and the Old World.In the process, he’d killed two men, supposedly with jujitsu chops to the neck—though the second case also involved a bullet to the skull.Perhaps that is why Jim Baker decided to become someone else entirely.
